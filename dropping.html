<p class="p"> the Victorian era,is a place in time when  Great britain was in its golden age as it had become the most powerful country in the world. during this periodâ€™s industrialisation started to really go forward. which meant a lot of people started leaving the outskirts to move into the inner cities to get jobs that paid better also the government demanded labor in the new factories.which resulted in  75% of the population was working class.
During this time we also had some inventions produce like the phone, <br><br> radio, railways and the sewing machines which was invented because of the industrialisation. because of this the communication, transportation and the newly found way of trading and shipping using steamboats. this was a fantastic way for Britania to improve its own economy.
steamboats also started to surface which made trading  and shipping to other countries possible and that greatly improved England's economy.<br><br>
England went from a population of just 16 million to a whopping 37 million during the Victorian era and the reason for that was because England was in such a good spot during that time so they had better health care which lowered the chance that a child would die and the fertility rate was higher so more women could get pregnant.as the educational system got better meant that a bigger part of the society could learn to read and write the english language
also the literature realism (the representation of reality). started to be popular around the public in the 1850 originated from France as a painting because realists rejected romanticism. which started a revolution of realism.<br><br> this still is a popular title but we can say that it went away at the start of world war one around 1914.  writings about daily life without artificially change the story into a fake reality such as magic and dramatic love stories. this, in the long run, changed the societal structure and even the political system in some sort of ways.</p>
