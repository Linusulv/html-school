<h6 class="p">During the reign of Queen Victoria Britain emerged as the most powerful trading nation in the world, provoking a social and economic revolution whose effects are still being felt today. Since the latter part of the eighteenth century,
   the process of industrialisation had built a firm foundation for nineteenth-century growth and expansion.
    At the heart of this was the successful development and application of steam technology.<br><br> Before 1800 brilliant engineers and entrepreneurs such as James Watt and Matthew Boulton had made steam power a practical
    reality that had radically improved Britain's core industries, namely the mining of coal, minerals and other raw materials and the production of iron, textiles and manufactured goods. With its advanced industrial technologies,
     Britain was able to attack a huge and rapidly expanding international market. </h6>

  <h6 class="p4"> Between 1809 and 1839 exports grew from £25.4 to £76 million.
  Ten years later the figure was £124.5 million, with the major export markets being Europe, India and Asia and, increasingly, the United States.
  At the start of Queen Victoria's reign, Britain's standing as a global industrial and trading power was already unrivalled.
  The complex structures of international trade developed by the Victorians and the maintenance of the process of wealth generation derived from them were dependent upon efficient means of communication.
  In many ways, the Victorians owe their unique place in history to their imaginative and successful exploitation of three new communication technologies, the steamship, the railway and the electric telegraph.

<h6 class="p7">
The steamship has a long, pre-Victorian ancestry, dating back at least to 1783 when the Marquis de Jouffray d'Abbans steamed his little boat, the Pyroscaphe, across the Seine. The first steam-assisted crossing of the Atlantic took place in 1819 when the Savannah sailed from Georgia to Liverpool in 633 hours. By 1833 the Atlantic crossing had been reduced to 22 days and steamships had begun to operate on the major Imperial and trade routes to India, South Africa and Australia. The 1830s were also marked by the founding of three major shipping lines, the British and American Steam Navigation Company, the Great Western Steamship Company and the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company.


</h6>

<h6 class="p8">  The first two concentrated their efforts on the Atlantic and their rivalry launched the period of frenetic
  competition on that route that was to continue throughout the Victorian period and well into the twentieth century.
In April 1838 the Great Western sailed from Bristol to New York in 14 days and 12 hours,
establishing the modern steamship era and the famous Blue Riband contest for the fastest transatlantic passage by passenger ships.

</h6>





<h6 class="p10">  The competition was intensified by the setting up by Samuel Cunard of a new shipping line. In July 1840 his first ship, the Britannia, crossed the Atlantic in 11 days and 4 hours. By 1901 the German liner the Deutschland could cross the Atlantic in under 5 days.



</h6>






<h6 class="p12">  The building of the railway network was the major achievement of the Victorian period, changing forever both social patterns and the landscape of Britain. The great engineers, Stephenson, Brunel, Locke, Vignoles and many others
  built their lines across hills and valleys, across mountains and marshland and over great rivers with determination and style, and often regardless of cost. Their legacy is the great embankments, viaducts, tunnels and bridges that cover the face
  of Britain, in many cases still visible long after the trains they served have disappeared. Their stations, wondrous constructions in iron and glass and great cathedrals to modernity, brought a new building type into British culture.
As the railway was, in essence, a British creation, it was readily exported to many parts of the world, as a concept, and in component form.




</h6>

<h6 class="p13"> British engineers, British construction teams and British capital built railways throughout the Empire,
in the Americas and in many parts of Europe. The famous railway contractor Thomas Brassey built railways in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Russia, India, Argentina and Australia. Imperial railway building projects were often inspired by strategic
as well as industrial and commercial motives,<br><br> but such projects, notably in India and Africa, opened up huge and long lasting markets to British manufacturers.British-made locomotives, rolling stock and railway equipment were exported around the world
throughout the Victorian period.




</h6>


<h6 class="p14">The spread of the railway in Victorian Britain was closely linked to the development of the electric telegraph. The idea of communicating via electricity dates back to the eighteenth century but it was the understanding of electromagnetism from the 1820s that gave the idea a practical reality. In 1837 Cooke and Wheatstone developed the electric telegraph which used an electric current to move magnetic needles and thus transmit messages in code. The first operational telegraph system linked Euston station and Camden town, and from there it spread all over the railway network, used both to carry messages and to control signalling. The technology of the telegraph rapidly expanded, making possible mass communication on both national and global scales. With instruments in every post office, the telegraph, and its visible offspring, the telegram, personal communication on a scale hitherto inconceivable became commonplace. A telegraph cable was laid across the Channel in 1851, followed by others across the Irish and North Seas.

</h6>
<h6 class="p16">In 1866 Brunel's huge ship, the Great Eastern, laid a durable telegraph cable across the Atlantic.
   The global network spread rapidly, with many countries establishing their own systems.
   Colonial, military and commercial implications were quickly appreciated.<br>
   By 1878 Britain had constructed two overland and one maritime telegraph links to India, part of a network that by the end of the century
    had reached almost every corner of the world. Related to the telegraph, but far more practical on a personal level, was the telephone,
    developed by the Scotsman Alexander Graham Bell in 1876.<br> By 1887 there were 26,000 telephones in use in Britain
    (and 150,000 in the United States) and multiple switchboards had been installed in most major towns and cities.

</h6>
<h6 class="p17">With the development by Marconi of practical radio transmissions at the very end of the nineteenth century, the foundations for the global communications systems of the twenty first century were in place in Victorian Britain.
In Britain, the attitudes and achievements of the Victorians are still part of many aspects of modern life today. These legacies are probably most tangible in the fields of communication.
<br><br>The Victorians not only built a British railway network which was more than twice as large as today's network but often operated with greater effiency. Urban transport systems such as buses and underground railways were also created by the Victorians. With those systems came the habit of commuting, one of the most durable and least appealing of nineteenth century legacies. The post service, the electric telegraph which was the forerunner of today's internet and the phone paved the way for the making of a world which relies heavily on complex structures of domestic and worldwide communications.
